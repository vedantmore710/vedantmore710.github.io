Resume - Website Assignment

ðŸ”¹ Profile Section
A professional touch was added by including a centered, circular profile photo in the header. It features a clean white border, a soft shadow, and a background color that matches the siteâ€™s primary theme. This addition enhances the visual identity of the resume and gives it a personal, approachable aesthetic.
ðŸ”¹ Responsive Design
To ensure the website looks great on all devices, responsive design techniques were applied using CSS media queries. The navigation bar and layout elements automatically adapt to screen size, offering a smooth, user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
ðŸ”¹ Dark Mode Support
Dark mode was integrated through a toggle-enabled CSS class. When activated, this mode adjusts the color scheme to darker tones, including backgrounds, text, and containers. This feature improves accessibility and reduces eye strain in low-light environments.
ðŸ”¹ Visual Aesthetics
The siteâ€™s font was updated to Poppins, giving it a modern and clean visual appeal. A cohesive color palette was implemented using CSS variables for easy maintenance and consistency. Section containers were styled with shadows, rounded corners, and spacing enhancements to provide a refined, card-based layout.
ðŸ”¹ Smooth Page Transitions
Subtle fade-in animations were applied to major elements like the header and content containers. These animations activate on each page load, creating a soft transition effect that enhances the overall flow and interactivity of the site.
